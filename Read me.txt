Dear users, please refer to the following instructions to generate your strategy report!

1.Install R and R libraries.
For Linux users, you can execute the bash file "install.sh" to establish R environment directly. 
For Windows users, you are recommended to install Rstudio and finish the same environment configuration manually.
After R is installed, you can execute "install.R" file by the command "Rscript install.R" to install all the necessary libraries.

2.Prepare input files
(1)The first input file is the .json file which you can download once you finish your backtesting. You could put this file into a convenient directory, such as ./json/sample.json.
(2)Then please replace the files "Profile.txt", "Profile.png", "Description.txt" with your own files, but do not change their names.

3.Generate report
Use the following command to generate your strategy report:
"Rscript Analyze.R ./json/sample.json Analyze.html ./"
Note: 
(1)The first parameter "Analyze.R" is the file we are going to execute, other function files are called inside this file.
(2)The second parameter "./json/sample.json" is your json file.
(3)The third parameter "Analyze.html" is the name of an informal version of html output.
(4)The fourth parameter "./" is the output directory.

4.Get the outputs
(1)Report.R
(2)all the individual images in the directory "images"
